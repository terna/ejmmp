    "To assess the quantity of capital our starting point is the Appendix B of Priori, Terna _et al._ (2025). There, we roughly state the following relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set a proportion, e.g., of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$ for the global compensations of labor and productive capital, we need a recipe $\\frac{K}{L}$ with, in a time unit:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{Kr}{n}=Lw$\n",
    "\n",
    "$K=\\frac{Lwn}{r}$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $w=1$, $L=1$, $n=12$, $r=0.10$, we obtain $K=120$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In real life a proportion of $120$ to $1$ between the productive capital per worker and the monthly compensation of a worker is not unrealistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We looked for some confirmation of this intuition in real data. Unfortunately, Eurostat data does not provide data on non-financial capital stocks, so we had to look for this information in Istat data:\n",
    "- http://dati.istat.it/Index.aspx?QueryId=37156 here there are data on gross and net non-fin capital stocks and depreciations for NACE sectors\n",
    "- http://dati.istat.it/Index.aspx?QueryId=12581 here there are data on occupation by sector in Italy\n",
    "- we update occupational data with the LC table, to incorporate information on labor cost (even if this reflects values fo EU and not only for Italy - data not available).\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular we look for some confirmation of this intuition by observing two examples (Manifacturing, which is a labor-intensive sector, and Coke, petrol, chemistry and farmaceutical, which is a capital-intensive one). \n",
    "- non-fin capital stock for manifacturing is 485.357.000.000 whereas the occupational data is 3.972.000. So its ratio is about 120.000.\n",
    "- non-fin capital stock for chemistry and others is about 60.000.000.000 (28.859.300.000 + 30.830.800.000 because they are classified as separate sectors, i.e., coke and petrol vs. chemistry and farmaceutical) and its occupational data (here classified as an aggregate sector) is 195.000. So the furthcoming ratio is about 300.000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are considering a monthly compensation of one unit of labor at the labor cost of $1$ to a value of capital equal to $120$, we need to account for annual compensation of workers per sector (reported in LC table).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the value of 120 is about ten times the annual compensation of workers, in the same way in that the ratio 300.000 is ten times the LC annual compensation of workers of 32.000 for coke, petrol, chemistry and farmaceutical (being considered as a sub-sector of manifacturing in the LC table). As far as concerns the whole manifacturing sector the value are close but not perfect beacuse we need to consider a higher capital compensation $r$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This makes perfectly sense as manifacture can be considered as a \"light\" sector where capital can obtain higher compensation per unit rather than coke, petrol, chemistry and farmaceutical, being a heavy sector with lower capital compensation per unit.\n",
