    "### Some useful instructions before running the model\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different files that one needs to know how to use to run the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main file is model1.2.ipynb, which contains the whole machinery of the model and all the instructions for the agents’ behaviors. The user has just to run the model from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters and information that feed the agents (i.e. firms) in the model come from two separate files, which model1.2.ipynb calls and uses as service files. Then, to operate some choices (both about technical issues of the model and about agents/model behaviors), the user must modify these parameters before running model1.2.ipynb.\n",
    "\n",
    "The  file **model1.yaml** rules the parameters of the model. The user must select the parameters from there to perform the run of the model. Notice: when you modify the model1.yaml file always remember to save your new changes!\n",
    "The file **firm-features.csv** contains all the information about the firms and their corresponding classification. The main file model1.2.ipynb generates the firms  and the corresponding detailed features according to this information.\n",
    "If some consistency between the information in the two files is required, this must be written in the model1.yaml file as a reminder of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is written by using **repast4py** to exploit the possibility of running it in parallel sessions by using more than one rank at a time. We have diffusely explained how repast4py works here. What is important to know now is that if one wants to run the model with a unique rank it is sufficient to run it by hitting the “play” button in a standard Jupyter Notebook. Otherwise, if the user wants to perform a multi-core test of the model, she needs to launch it by using the terminal and apply the command: mpirun -n 3 ipython model1.2.ipynb.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a new test of the model, the first choice that the user must take in the parameters file model1.yaml is to choose a name for the destination folder in the parameter log_file_root. If she is performing a multi-core run of the model, she will obtain how many folders as the number of ranks.\n",
    "Launching the model will generate one or more new folder(s) with the name (**log_file_root**) selected by the user followed by “.” and the number of the rank where the run is performed (e.g. if the user chooses “prova” as log_file_root and single-rank analysis is performed, the folder name will be “prova.0”). The model is programmed to send both the file model1.yaml and the firm-features.csv file to the newly generated folder(s), so that one can always know which was the starting set of parameters coming from the two files. \n",
    "\n",
    "After this, the model also sends to the folder a number of csv files corresponding to the number of firms, where the name of each of these files is the log_file_root followed by the uid of the firm, which is a tuple containing the rank where the firm operates, the type of the agent and the number of the firm. Our folder prova.0 contains all the firm balancesheets of the specific rank in a unique file with extension \".p\". All of these files contain the cross-temporal observations of different variables for each of the firms in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with this large mass of data, we prepared other two service files, which operate to elaborate the data produced by model1.2.ipynb. These files are **data_analysis-series.ipynb**, **data_analysis-balancesheets.ipynb** and **data_analysis-planner.ipynb**. When the user launches one or both of them, she will be asked to insert the name of the input folder (without the extension defining the rank number) and then will obtain a complete data analysis of the model, with also graphical representation, the national economic balance sheet, and the opportunity to explore in a more detailed way the path of a single firm and/or of a given span of time (information on how to do that are contained in the service file data_analysis-balancesheets.ipynb).\n"
